Game focused on parry mechanics:

You get a single attack, a sword swing
if you swing into a enemy in neutral, they parry and hit you back
if you swing into a enemy in recovery, you hit
first ~10 frames of your swing is a parry, this is wwhat the game is all about

movement will be fast and committal, mimicking platform fighters:

initial uncancellable* dash when moving that moves at a boosted speed
*can be cancelled with an attack to inherit inertia
transforms into a run when held
fast fall
dashing backwards will keep you facing forward until the dash is half over and you start a run
movment should NEVER be start-and-go, everything needs build-up and wind-down, intertia and acceleration. we love += -=

Stage is simple one screen platform:

1 enemy will spawn, then 2, then max at 3
stage will likely be Smash bros battlefield, maybe variants
something fancy with falling off maybe, but no smash-bros mechanics

Enemies will be simple, 3 moves that RPS the player:

*maybe* have a tell for when they will attack, depends it if makes it too easy
have a initial fast attack, not too fast to react too;
then a slow attack intended to bait the fast parry;
then something inbetween to catch patient players
probably be simple silhouettes
a system so while 2 enemies can attack a player at any instance, they don't do it at the same time.
